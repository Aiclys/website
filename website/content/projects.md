#### This site is a list of projects of mine, ranging from small projects like a one-liner bookmark script to bigger projects like this website. All of the source code is available on my own [Gitea instance](https://git.nyrslab.org/) and on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/)

### My projects
#### - **[Simple number game]():** A simple number game program with 3 different games written in python. Game 1 is a largest number guesser, game 2 is a smallest number guesser and game 3 is a random number guesser.

#### - **[Bookmarks.sh]():** Just a simple one-liner for all of my bookmarks using dmenu.

#### - **[Emojis.sh]():** Simple one-liner using dmenu to have an emoji menu.

#### - **[Quotes]():** A simple bash script that displays random quotes I like using dmenu.

#### - **[Nyrs's garden](https://nyrsgarden.org/):** My personal website. It was built using the Hugo static site generator and my own theme called [Bonsai]() based on the [Nightfall theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-nightfall/). Feel free to use it as a base template for your own website.

#### - **[NyrsArch]():** This is an Arch Linux installation script I made because I didn't want to do it manually all of the time. There is a guided and an automatic mode. With this script you also have the option to install my [dotfiles]() along with default Arch. 

#### - **[Nyrstile]():** These are my personal dotfiles for Arch Linux and arch-based distros. I use the Qtile window manager as it is written and configured in python, which is handy as I already know python, and it has [excellent documentation](https://docs.qtile.org/en/stable/). For more information on what software I use, go have a look at the resources page.

#### - **[Essentials](/posts/essentials):** This is my own take at making a viable essentials library in python. It contains a math module, a random module and I'm currently still working on other basic modules that provide a better python experience. It's all made using vanilla python without any external libraries or other built-in modules.
