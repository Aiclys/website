# About this website
### This website is my digital garden where I can share my thoughts freely without restrictions. I will mostly be rambling about recent projects of mine, philosophy, my Linux journey, online privacy and FLOSS(Free/Libre Open Source Software). Expect a new article/post once every month or so as I'm pretty busy with school.  



# About Me 

### Hi! I am a german student who is very passionate about GNU/Linux (BSD is pretty cool aswell), FLOSS, programming and cryptography. I am also an avid reader(I'm currently reading Necronomicon from HP Lovecraft and it's a masterpiece!) so I might write a review of a book I read. You can contact me via email by clicking [here](mailto:aiclys@proton.me)
