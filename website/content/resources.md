# Linux and BSD resources:
- ####  The [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is one of the best places to learn about Arch Linux and its many features. Although it's called ArchWiki, alot of the information on there can be applied to ther Linux distributions which makes this resource very handy.Make sure to read or search through the FAQ carefully as most questions you may have will almost certainly be already answered. The Arch Linux Forum is also a great place to communicate with Arch users around the world
- #### The [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/) is a great place to learn about the Gentoo GNU/Linux distribution. It is also known for having excellent documentation like the ArchWiki and the FreeBSD Handbook. As with Arch Linux, there is a huge community behind Gentoo which makes it easy to talk find someone to talk with about Gentoo specific problems or issues.
- #### [Linux die](https://linux.die.net) is a place where you can find really good documentation centered around Linux and its environment. The manuals are relatively easy to understand and there is alot of content for beginners and advanced users alike. To list some of the manuals/how-tos there are networking, system administration, bash-scripting guides and many more.
- #### [TLDP(The Linux Documentation Project)](https://tldp.org/) is one of if not the best place to find extensive and complete documentation about the Linux ecosystem. Although it is meant for rather advanced Linux users who already have a basic understanding of Linux there are still great guides for beginners.
- #### The [GNU Manuals](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.en.html/) are a great place to find extensive, advanced and comprehensible documentation about the GNU utils, FSF-related software and other applications related to FLOSS, GNU/Linux and programming. A handy feutere is that you can download almost all of the manuals as PDFs so you can have access to them even when you don't have an internet connection. There are also links to further resources about the specific app or language which is very handy.
- #### The [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) is a website targeted at Linux noobs who consider switching from Windows or Mac. There are plenty of easy short tutorials about Linux basics like Vim, the command line and other things. There are also exercizes to test your capabilities. Overall it is a great introduction to Linux and its perks and features and I would highly recommend it to people who are new to the concept of GNU/Linux.
- #### The [FreeBSD Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/) is probably the single best piece of documentation there is for an OS. It is very extensive and easy to understand and is suited for everyone who wants to learn about FreeBSD, beginners and advanced users alike.  
- #### The [OpenBSD Handbook](https://www.openbsdhandbook.com/) and the [OpenBSD Man Pages](https://man.openbsd.org/) are great resources for learning about OpenBSD. Like everything from OpenBSD these resources are very extensive and meant for advanced users.
- ####  The [BSD for Linux users blog](https://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01/) is a really great blog I found online that talks about the main differences between Linux and BSD and the personal experience of a FreeBSD user. Although it is a subjective blog, it is really informative and does a great job at explaining BSD concepts. Keep in mind that the target audience are Linux users who already hove a bit of knowledge about Linux.

# Online privacy resources:
### When browsing through privacy resources always think and reflect about the things you read. Alot of privacy guides are sponsored by big privacy-shilling companies like NordVpn or ExpressVpn. To check if a site has affiliate links for some services, which they will undoubtedly shill and promote, you can hover over links to see if there is a sign of something related to affiliate. If you realy need privacy for work or otherwise, use Tor and do your own research, don't trust random people on the internet.

# Software I use:
#### All my configurations and dotfiles can be found on my GitHub at [https://github.com/Aiclys](https://github.com/Aiclys)
![dotfiles](/gruv-1.png)


- ### Operating systems:
    #### I use Arch(btw) Linux as my main OS and Debian as my server operating system. It just works and gives me pretty much unlimited freedom and I always have the newest version of software. Once you set it up the right way, it's basically no work anymore to maintain it. As I just started my Linux journey 4 and a half months ago I still want to try other distros such as Gentoo or NixOs. I also installed FreeBSD on my second SSD because I want to learn about BSD and its perks and features.

- ### Shell:
    #### I use zsh with the [oh-my-zsh framework](https://oh-myz.sh) because I am to lazy to configure zsh myself and it has some nice prebuilt features. Many people say that it is bloated or slow but I personally only saw a miniscule difference between bash and oh-my-zsh in terms of speed and responsiveness.

- ### Window Manager:
    #### [Qtile](https://qtile.org/) is my window manager of choice. I already am a Python noob which is why it was fairly easy for me to get into qtile. Due to it being configured and written in Python it is also very easy to add your own widgets, panels and modules based on your level of knowledge in Python. The documentation is pretty good and the WM is really fast and lightweight aswell. My configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/Aiclys/dotfiles)

- ### Terminal:
    #### I use [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as my terminal emulator as it is very fast and customizable and the documentation covers pretty much everything you could want. It also offers GPU rendering like [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) which is pretty handy.

- ### Compositor:
    #### [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) is the compositor I use to have cool blur and transparency effects. It is very customizable and has alot of forks that have cool animations and effects preconfigured like [dccsillag's picom](https://github.com/dccsillag/picom), [FT-Labs's picom](https://github.com/FT-Labs/picom) and many more.

- ### Browsers:
    #### I use multiple browsers for multiple things. I use [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and I'm currently also trying out [PaleMoon](https://www.palemoon.org/). These all are secure and privacy respecting, which is a very important thing to me. I also use multiple extension: [LibRedirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/libredirect/) so I don't have to look at horrible websites such as Twitter, Reddit etc, [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block ads and trackers (I'm thinking about switching to [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/) as it gives you more controll over your privacy) and [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/) which acts like a local CDN and can bypass CDN tracking. Oh and I also use [Vimium C](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/) to have Vim keybinds.
    
- ### File Managers:
  #### [Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) is my GUI file manager. It is simple, lightweight and easily customizable. I also use a CLI file manager called [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) that uses Vim keybindings and is pretty fast and extensible.
  
- ### Email Client:
  #### I used [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) as my mail client in the past but it's just to bloated and full of Mozilla telemetry. Since about 1 month I use [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) which is lightweight, blazingly fast and customizable. It's just much better than any other mail client I've used in the past.

- ### Text Editors:
  #### [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) is my editor of choice. Thanks to evil mode it has all of the Vim bindings so it combines the power of GNU Emacs and Vim which makes it very practical to use. If I were proficient enough in Elisp I would probably build my own Emacs with plugins that I want but I hardly understand anything related to Elisp at the moment.

- ### App Launcher: 
  #### I first considered using dmenu as my application launcher because I liked the Suckless philosophy but then I found [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) which is basically dmenu with more features and less hurdles. It's very easy to configure and it's very fast and light. I recommend [Adi1090x's rofi configs](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) to get started.
