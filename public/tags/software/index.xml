      <description>Why I dislike bloated software Something I strongly dislike is bloat. A piece of software can be described as being bloated if it is full of unnecessary or even unwanted features. A perfect example would be the modern internet. Everything is full of malicious javascript code that intends to steal your data, which is then sold to the highest bidder. The simplest, most basic sites like recipe sites are full of javascript, which greatly increases the attack surface and is completely redundant considering the use of the website.</description>
