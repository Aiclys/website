      <description>I want to start this with a quote: Arguing that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don&amp;rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. - Edward Snowden I really don&amp;rsquo;t know where this comes from but there is a common misconception that online privacy is for cybercriminals only. When talking to normal people about online privacy and anonymity you will often hear them say &amp;ldquo;But I have nothing to hide, so why should I even care.</description>
