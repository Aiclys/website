#### I want to start this with a quote:
> #### *Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.*
#### - *Edward Snowden*

#### I really don't know where this comes from but there is a common misconception that online privacy is for cyber criminals only. When talking to normal people about online privacy and anonymity you will often hear them say "But I have nothing to hide, so why should I even care. I am no criminal.". This is an idiotic statement. Why should you have the right to be private in real life but not on the internet? Furthermore, does it mean that you are a criminal because you want to be private when you are at home? Of course criminals would benefit from being private online but following this argument, this would mean that you also don't have a right to be private at home because criminals want to be private at home. This is nonsensical. 

#### Being on the internet nowadays feels like you are constantly being followed and monitored by four or five big companies. They can watch you any day at any time and they know everything about you. But that's not the only problem. What happens if a data breach occurs? The companies who have all of your data get hacked, which happens very often, and then suddenly they aren't the only one who have your data because it is now sold on a Tor forum. Moreover, these companies sell your information to data brokers who are complete strangers to you. Would you give all of your personal information and a list of every person you know to a random person you see on the street? I doubt it. So why should you do so when browsing the internet?

## Loss of privacy is equal to a loss of freedom
#### We all know that [the freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), [the freedom of assiociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association), [the freedom of assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly) and [the right to personal identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_personal_identity) are intrinsic freedoms of a working democracy. With the loss of privacy however, these rights and freedoms aren't garanteed anymore. 

#### Your freedom of speech is threatened by the [mass surveillance of the population by intelligence agencies like the NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM) which was famously uncovered by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Your internet usage is being heavily monitored and surveilled. The knowledge that you are being monitored leads to [self-censoring](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/are-we-done-fighting/202107/the-rise-self-censorship), which can lead to mental health issues. This not only makes you less likely to research a specific topic, it also leads to your thoughts being pushed in a certain direction. This harms society as a whole as less and less people are willing to give us their perspectives on a certain topic which leads to a decreease in the development of further ideas.

#### Both your freedom of assembly and your freedom of assiociation are being eroded by the constant surveillance of your mobile devices. All of your WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Discord messages are being monitored. If you don't trust me, take a look at their privacy policies. You get a feeling of privacy when communicating with someone online while this is far from being the truth. Furthermore, you are always being tracked through your mobile phone and smart watches and features like Siri or Alexa who literally record everything while waiting for you to pronounce their name. This is profoundly detrimental to activism and change in society, as shown by the fact that the Australian government [tried to censor climate activists just some years ago](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/18/coalition-unexpectedly-pushes-on-with-green-lawfare-legislation-plan). Do you think that womens rights activists would have achieved what they did centuries ago if they were being as heavily surveilled as we are today? I don't think so.

#### The right to personal identity is being supressed as well. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) also known as the Strasbourg Court says that [the right to personal identity comes hand in hand with the right to have a private life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_personal_identity#Private%20life), as stated in Article 8:
> #### *Article 8 protects against unwanted intrusion and provides for the respect of an individual's private space.*
#### The [ECHR Online](http://echr-online.info/article-8-echr/) also states that the scope of Article 8 is to embrace the freedom to make choices without the interference of the state or any other institution to develop one's own personal life.
#### To quote professor Marshall:
> #### *This space is needed for individuals to think reflectively without interference and to be in control of one's own faculties.*
#### This supposed "protection of inner privacy" should allow individuals to develop and cultivate their personal identity.
#### This simply isn't the case on the modern internet as I pointed out in the above.

## What you do have to hide and why
#### Small bits of information about you that you might not feel the need to hide or even think twice about can be used to create an almost complete profile of your online persona. This technique is called [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (Open Source Intelligence) which is often used in combination with [other tools](https://osintframework.com/) to track and monitor people. To give you a glimpse of the power of OSINT, [it is possible to find the exact location of your home, workplace and your family member's home along with an accurate map of the places you have recently visited and the people you've met](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-24/metadata-what-you-found-will-ockenden/6703626).

#### This can be and is already used regularly to deanonimze activists and other people that are considered to be as a threat to the state. The level of intrusion becomes even more frightening once you realize how much data can be collected across a whole population. It has even come so far that your online behavior can accurately be predicted by social media algorithms like the TikTok and the Instagram algorithm. Don't think that it can't get worse. Artificial intelligence and algorithms are only getting better and better which leaves us to wonder to what degree the surveillance will grow in the future.

#### If you want to get a feeling of what data is being harvested through your browser alone, visit [this site](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/). You can also read some articles about the power of metadata like [this one](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-17/metadata-retention-privacy-phone-will-ockenden/6694152) (it is a bit older which means that even more is being collect nowadays) which will give you a little insight into the tracking device you call your phone. For the lazy folks that don't want to read other articles I'll list some of the things that can be known about you at any moment on the internet, keep in mind that this is only the tip of the iceberg:
- #### your location
- #### the place you are going to
- #### your home address
- #### all of your contacts
- #### the people you are communicating with
- #### your family members
- #### your religious beliefs
- #### your political beliefs
- #### your desires
- #### your full name
- #### your date of birth
- #### your age
- #### your sympathies
- #### your wealth status
#### and much more.

## Global surveillance
#### Edward Snowden is one of the most infamous whistleblowers to exist. He leaked countless classified documents regarding the global mass surveillance programs of the NSA and the [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes). Thanks to his work we now know that we are constantly being monitored by the government and big tech companies as he revealed that they were working together under a program with the name of [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM). The countries that are involved are [the US, the UK, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Sweden.](https://cybernews.com/resources/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes-countries/), which can be described as the 5/9/14 eyes alliance. This aliance is essentially a global surveillance alliance, which has far-reaching implications for personal privacy. The full extent of how much the intelligence agencies in these countries know about you is vague and likely to never be known exactly, but [Snowden's leaks](https://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-leaks-timeline-2016-9?op=1&r=US&IR=T) make it clear that your online activities, phone conversations and basically everything about your digital life are a part of it.

## Surveillance does not protect you
#### Contrary to popular belief, government surveillance does not protect you. Many, many internet censorship laws are currently being passed under the false pretext of being for the safety of the population while it's actually being used to strengthen the state's already firm grip on it's inhabitants. Furthermore, [a 2013 survey of US writers](https://pen.org/research-resources/chilling-effects/) shows that a large portion of writers self-censored after the revelation of the NSA surveillance by Edward Snowden. Moreover, [another study](https://pen.org/press-clip/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance/) confirms that a significant majority of writers said they were deeply concerned with government surveillance, with many reporting that they even avoided, or have considered avoiding, controversial topics in their work as a result.

#### Society as a whole strongly benefits from the progress that occurs when activists and journal
