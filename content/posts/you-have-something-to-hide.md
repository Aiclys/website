#### I want to start this with a quote:
> #### *Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.*
#### - *Edward Snowden*

#### I really don't know where this comes from but there is a common misconception that online privacy is for cyber criminals only. When talking to normal people about online privacy and anonymity you will often hear them say "But I have nothing to hide, so why should I even care. I am no criminal.". This is an idiotic statement. Why should you have the right to be private in real life but not on the internet? Furthermore, does it mean that you are a criminal because you want to be private when you are at home? Of course criminals would benefit from being private online but following this argument, this would mean that you also don't have a right to be private at home because criminals want to be private at home. This is nonsensical. 

#### Being on the internet nowadays feels like you are constantly being followed and monitored by four or five big companies. They can watch you any day at any time and they know everything about you. But that's not the only problem. What happens if a data breach occurs? The companies who have all of your data get hacked, which happens very often, and then suddenly they aren't the only one who have your data because it is now sold on a Tor forum. Moreover, these companies sell your information to data brokers who are complete strangers to you. Would you give all of your personal information and a list of every person you know to a random person you see on the street? I doubt it. So why should you do so when browsing the internet?

## Loss of privacy is equal to a loss of freedom
#### We all know that [the freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), [the freedom of assiociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association), [the freedom of assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly) and [the right to personal identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_personal_identity) are intrinsic freedoms of a working democracy. With the loss of privacy however, these rights and freedoms aren't garanteed anymore. 

#### Your freedom of speech is threatened by the [mass surveillance of the population by intelligence agencies like the NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM) which was famously uncovered by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Your internet usage is being heavily monitored and surveilled. The knowledge that you are being monitored leads to [self-censoring](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/are-we-done-fighting/202107/the-rise-self-censorship), which can lead to mental health issues. This not only makes you less likely to research a specific topic, it also leads to your thoughts being pushed in a certain direction. This harms society as a whole as less and less people are willing to give us their perspectives on a certain topic which leads to a decreease in the development of further ideas.

#### Both your freedom of assembly and your freedom of assiociation are being eroded by the constant surveillance of your mobile devices. All of your WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Discord messages are being monitored. If you don't trust me, take a look at their privacy policies. You get a feeling of privacy when communicating with someone online while this is far from being the truth. Furthermore, you are always being tracked through your mobile phone and smart watches and features like Siri or Alexa who literally record everything while waiting for you to pronounce their name. This is profoundly detrimental to activism and change in society, as shown by the fact that the Australian government
