## WHy I dislike bloated software 
#### Something I strongly dislike is bloat. A piece of software can be designed as bloated if it is full of unnecessary or even unwanted features. A perfect example would be the modern internet. Everything is full of malicious javascript code that intends to steal your personal data, which is later sold to the highest bidder. The simplest, most basic sites like recipe sites are full of javascript, which is completely redundant considering the use of the website. Why does every site need to connect to ten different Cloudflare or Google domains? This also leads to poor experience on the users end, which is kind of hypocritical, because everything is much slower than it needs to be. Bloat is also prevalent in other applications. Take PowerPoint for example: Does it need to have millions of other side-features nobody uses or even asked for? These extra features only complicate the simple task of creating a slide presentation. Same thing with Thunderbird.
