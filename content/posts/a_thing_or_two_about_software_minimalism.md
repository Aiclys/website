## Why I dislike bloated software 
#### Something I strongly dislike is bloat. A piece of software can be designed as bloated if it is full of unnecessary or even unwanted features. A perfect example would be the modern internet. Everything is full of malicious javascript code that intends to steal your personal data, which is later sold to the highest bidder. The simplest, most basic sites like recipe sites are full of javascript, which is completely redundant considering the use of the website. Why does every site need to connect to ten different Cloudflare or Google domains? This also leads to poor experience on the users end, which is kind of hypocritical, because everything is much slower than it needs to be. Bloat is also prevalent in other applications. Take PowerPoint for example: Does it need to have millions of other side-features nobody uses or even asked for? These extra features only complicate the simple task of creating a slide presentation. Same thing with Thunderbird. 

## What is the cause of modern bloat?
#### This all gets even worse once you realize that there is a simple way to avoid all of this bloat. Developers just have to create something simple that fulfills its purpose efficiently instead of trying to make their a[[ be good at everything. that's all it takes. THe problem is that no company wants that. Every company is trying to trap you into their own ecosystem so that you need to rely on one company to provide for all of your consumer needs. No company actually wants you to truly enjoy their product, they want to make as much money as possible with the least amount of work possible.

#### This isn't the only cause of modern bloat though. One thing I realized when I was trying to learn javascript about 2 years ago is that when doing web dev, you aren't actually coding in vanilla js, you are much rather using some popular framework like React.js, Node.js etc. This great for the dev as he has a more pleasant development experience but it makes a pretty noticable sacrifice on the end of the user: performance. You don't have to be a genius or a javascript wizard to come to this conclusion. it should be common sense that a website will be considerably slower if it connects to 10 different domains at the same time while being written in a very resource heavy js framework.

## But what can I do about it?
#### On the surface it seems like you can't do anything to combat the bloat, but there are alot of things you can do. First of all, use a content blocker when browsing the internet. Not an adblocker but a content blocker. They are two different things
