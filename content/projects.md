#### This site lists some of my projects, ranging from small one-lines to bigger projects like this website. All of the source code is available on my own [Gitea instance](https://git.nyrslab.org/), on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aiclys), on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/aiclys) and on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/)

### My projects
#### - **[simple number game]():** A simple number game program with 3 different games written in python. Game 1 is a largest number guesser, game 2 is a smallest number guesser and game 3 is a random number guesser.

#### - **[nyrs' garden](https://nyrs.garden):** My personal website. It was built using the Hugo static site generator and my own theme called [Bonsai](https://github.com/Aiclys/Bonsia-Hugo-theme) based on the [Nightfall theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-nightfall/). Feel free to use it as a base template for your own website.

#### - **[mAis](https://github.com/Aiclys/mais):** This is an Arch Linux installation script I made because I didn't want to do it manually all of the time. mAis stands for "my Arch installation script". There is a guided and an automatic mode. With this script you also have the option to install my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Aiclys/dotfiles) along with default Arch. 

#### - **[my personal dotfiles](https://github.com/Aiclys/dotfiles):** These are my personal dotfiles for Arch Linux and arch-based distros. I use the Qtile window manager as it is written and configured in python, which is handy as I already know python, and it has [excellent documentation](https://docs.qtile.org/en/stable/). For more information on what software I use, go have a look at the resources page.

#### - **[pyssentials](https://github.com/Aiclys/pyssentials):** This is my own take at making a viable essentials library in python. It contains a math module, a random module and I'm currently still working on other basic modules that provide a better python experience. It's all made using vanilla python without any external libraries or other built-in modules.

#### - **[jabba's realm](https://github.com/Aiclys/Jabba-s-Realm):** Jabba's Realm is a project I am currently working on with two of my friends. We're trying to create a StarWars shop with PyQt5, basically a black market with Star Wars related stuff like spaceships, weapons, droids, other vehicles and creatures. Of course there aren't only Items that are in the Star-Wars canon. There are also alot of weapons that can only be found in the Star-Wars video games or fan-fiction.
